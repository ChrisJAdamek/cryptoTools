# Crypto Tools 101
Journey down the rabbit hole with this hands-on tutorial. Learn the tools of the crypto trade. 

## Introduction

Crypto Tools 101 is Part I of a tutorial series designed for beginners to learn crypto concepts in a simulated environment. You will learn how to use a non-custodial wallet to interact with a smart contract platform, hold and receive crypto tokens, join a DAO, and participate in an online community. 

### Polygon Network

[Polygon PoS Network](https://youtu.be/IijtdpAtOt0) is a smart contract platform based primarily on the code-base of the Ethereum Network (i.e. it is an EVM Network). This workshop involves a set of smart contracts pre-deployed on the Polygon Network.

EVM networks like Polygon charge fees to process transaction. However, Polygon's implementation of the EVM is such that fees are extremely low. A few cents worth of MATIC (the fee token for the Polygon Network) is sufficient for multiple transactions. You will receive a few cents of MATIC after completing Level 0. 

With the exception of receiving a few cents of MATIC, you will *not be interacting with any assets of value*.  You will only be interacting with smart contracts deployed for the purpose of this tutorial. 

### Metamask

[Metamask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaMask) is a non-custodial crypto wallet and the most popular gateway for interacting with blockchain networks and decentralised applications.  This tutorial may be most conveniently completed using the mobile version of Metamask. You will not need to 'sign-up' to use Metamask. 

The Metamask Mobile app has a built-in browser. You will need to use this browser for any tasks that involve authenticating ownership of an account (these tasks are marked as 'CONNECT').

While there are numerous security implication of self-custodying valuable tokens (particularly on a mobile application), this tutorial will not involve assets of value.  Accordingly, it is not necessary to the best practices of self-custody (for example, using a hardware wallet). The accounts generated for the purpose of this tutorial should be abandoned once the series of tutorials is complete (with the NFTs transferred to a more secure account as a momento, if desired). 

### Discord

[Discord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord_(software)) is an instant messaging platform that is segregated into community 'servers'. It is _not_ a blockchain-native application. You will be required to 'sign up' with an email address to use Discord. The email adddress will not be public. *Using a psuedonym for your display name will likely make the exercises in Part II more interesting and realistic*. 

Discord is commonly used as a community coordination tool in the computer game and crypto industries. Access to the Discord server set up for the purpose of this tutorial will be available only to tutorial participants. 

## Scenario 

You are looking for a job in the crypto industry.  You see a role advertised at Crypto Tools Pty Ltd. You must apply for the role and meet the requirements for promotion from Level 0 to Level 2. You also have the option of seeking promotion to Level 4, which will provide additional benefits in the second part of this tutorial. 

Throughout your career with Crypto Tools Pty Ltd, you will earn the following fungible and non-fungible tokens: 

1. **BUCKS** -- a (ficticious) currency in the form of an [ERC20 fungible token](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/).  You will earn BUCKS as you progress through the employment levels. 

2. **cryptoTool NFTs** -- a (fictitious) proof of employment credentials held by employees of **Crypto Tools Pty Ltd**.  The credentials are in the form of an [ERC-721 non-fungible token](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/). You will receive your cryptoTools NFT after completing Level 0. 

*All tokens are entirely valueless.* 

## Tasks and Exercises 

### üß∞ Level 0 - Opening the Tool Box
You want to apply for a role with Crypto Tools Pty Ltd.  Employees are required to have their own tools. Install the mobile versions of 'Metamask' and 'Discord' from the Android or iOS App Stores. 

Tools and Tasks:

1. **Metamask Mobile** --> Generate a fresh EVM account. ([help!](/HELPME.md))

2. **Discord Mobile** --> Join the [CryptoTools Discord Server]. 

3. **Discord Mobile** --> Post your EVM address using the channel `#apprentice-applications`. ([help!](/HELPME.md))

*Successful Applications: 1 MATIC (for gas), 10 BUCKS.*
