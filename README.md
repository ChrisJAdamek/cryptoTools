## Getting started
​
### Setting up Metamask Mobile

​
### Using Blockscout
For this tutorial we'll interact with our contracts through [Blockscout](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/), Gnosis Chain's block explorer. 

-> 

​

​

#### Transaction status
​
You sent a transaction, and it is shown as... This can mean two things:
​
-   Your transaction is pending, and will be included in a block shortly. It will then be visible in voyager.
-   Your transaction was invalid, and will NOT be included in a block (there is no such thing as a failed transaction in StarkNet).
​
You can (and should) check the status of your transaction with the following URL  [https://alpha4.starknet.io/feeder_gateway/get_transaction_receipt?transactionHash=](https://alpha4.starknet.io/feeder_gateway/get_transaction_receipt?transactionHash=)  , where you can append your transaction hash.
