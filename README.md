# Crypto Tools 101
Journey down the rabbit hole with this hands-on tutorial. Learn the tools of the crypto trade. 

## Introduction

Crypto Tools 101 is Part I of a tutorial series designed for beginners to learn crypto concepts in a simulated environment. In Part I, you will learn about: 
- generating accounts and addresses with non-custodial wallets
- receiving and self-custodying fugible and non-fungible tokens
- participating in online communities
- sending messages as a method of transacting on blockchain networks
- using accounts as a method of authenticating identity (signing messages)
- using tokens as a method of authenticating identity (token gates)
- investing in Moloch DAOs
- following useful resources on Crypto Twitter (optional)
- planning a governance attack (optional)

### Polygon Network

[Polygon PoS Network](https://youtu.be/IijtdpAtOt0) is a smart contract platform based primarily on the code-base of the Ethereum Network (i.e. an EVM Network). This workshop involves a set of smart contracts pre-deployed on the Polygon Network.

[EVM Networks](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/what-is-the-ethereum-virtual-machine-evm) like Polygon charge fees to process transaction. However, Polygon's implementation of the EVM is such that fees are extremely low. A few cents worth of MATIC (the fee token for the Polygon Network) is sufficient for multiple transactions. You will receive a few cents of MATIC after completing Level 0. 

With the exception of receiving a few cents of MATIC, you will *not be interacting with any assets of value*.  You will only be interacting with smart contracts deployed for the purpose of this tutorial. 

### Metamask

[Metamask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaMask) is a non-custodial crypto wallet and the most popular gateway for interacting with blockchain networks and decentralised applications.  This tutorial may be most conveniently completed using the mobile version of Metamask. You will not need to 'sign-up' to use Metamask. 

The Metamask Mobile app has a built-in browser. You will need to use this browser for any tasks that involve authenticating ownership of an account (these tasks are marked as 'CONNECT').

While there are numerous security implications of self-custodying valuable tokens (particularly on a mobile application), this tutorial will not involve assets of any value.  Accordingly, it is not necessary to follow self-custody best practices (for example, using a hardware wallet). The accounts generated for the purpose of this tutorial should be abandoned once the series of tutorials is complete - with the NFTs transferred to a more secure account (as we may want to use this to simulate DAO voting in future). 

### Discord

[Discord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord_(software)) is an instant messaging platform that is segregated into community 'servers'. It is _not_ a blockchain-native application. You will be required to 'sign up' with an email address to use Discord. The email adddress will not be public. *Using a psuedonym for your display name will likely make the exercises in Part II more interesting and realistic*. 

Discord is commonly used as a community coordination tool in the computer game and crypto industries. Access to the Discord server set up for the purpose of this tutorial will be available only to tutorial participants. 

## Scenario 

You are looking for a job in the crypto industry.  You see a role advertised at Crypto Tools Pty Ltd. You must apply for the role and meet the requirements for promotion from Level 0 to Level 2. You also have the option of seeking promotion to Level 4, which will provide additional benefits in the second part of this tutorial. 

Throughout your career with Crypto Tools Pty Ltd, you will earn the following fungible and non-fungible tokens: 

1. **BUCKS** -- a (ficticious) currency in the form of an [ERC20 fungible token](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/).  You will earn BUCKS as you progress through the employment levels. 

2. **cryptoTool NFTs** -- a (fictitious) proof of employment credentials held by employees of Crypto Tools Pty Ltd.  The credentials are in the form of an [ERC-721 non-fungible token](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/). You will receive your cryptoTools NFT after completing Level 1. 

*All tokens are entirely valueless.* 

## Tasks and Exercises 

### 🧰 Level 0 - Opening the Tool Box
You want to apply for a role with Crypto Tools Pty Ltd.  Employees are required to have their own tools. You must install the mobile versions of 'Metamask' and 'Discord' and prove you have the basic tools for the job. 

**Skills**: generating accounts and addresses with non-custodial wallets, receiving fungible tokens, participating in an online community.

**Bounty:** 1 MATIC (for gas), 1 cryptoTools NFT.

**Tasks:** 

1. **Metamask** --> Generate a fresh EVM account. ([help!](/HELPME.md))

2. **Discord** --> Join the [cryptoTools Discord Server](https://discord.gg/2qv6qtzm) (use a psuedonym). 

3. **Discord** --> Post your new EVM address in Discord using the channel `#job-applications`. ([help!](/HELPME.md))


### xx 👷 Level 1 - First-Day Apprentice 
It's your first day on the job. You've been told to head into the `#apprentice-lounge` channel in Discord. The channel is hidden for the public.  You'll need to authenticate your address to enter. 

**Skills:** using tokens as a method of authenticating identity (token gates), using accounts as a method of identity (signing messages), participating in online communities. 

**Bounty:** 30 BUCKS

**Tasks:**

1. **OpenSea** --> CONNECT to [OpenSea.io](https://opensea.io/account) to check that your cryptoTools NFT is in your account ([help!](/HELPME.md)).

2. **Discord/Metamask** --> CONNECT to token gate using the instructions in the Discord `#collab-land` channel. 

3. **Discord** --> introduce your psuedonomous identify in the newly opened `#apprentice-lounge`. 


### xx 🗳️ Level 2 - Joining the Union 
You hear that some of your colleagues are unionising. Someone has set up a [Moloch DAO](https://daohaus.club/docs#what-is-moloch) to take membership fees and issue shares in the new toolUnion DAO. A membership costs 20 BUCKS. You decide to join. 

**Skills:** 

**Bounty:** 30 BUCKS

**Tasks:** 

1. **DAOhaus** --> follow the instruction in `#apprentice-lounge` to apply to join the ToolUnion ([help!](/HELPME.md)).


### xx 🎓 Level 3 - Over Qualified (Optional)
You keep overhearing your colleagues making [jokes about Crypto Linkedin](/Linkedin-jokes.md/). You get the impression that the serious experts in the space hang out on Crypto Twitter. You decide its time to jump onboard. 

*tasks coming soon...*


### xx 👴👵 Level 4 - Past Prime (Optional)
You notice in Discord that the `#past-prime-lounge` channel is now open to you. You read the secret message and take the appropriate action. 

*tasks coming soon...*
