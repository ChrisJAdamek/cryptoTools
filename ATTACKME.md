# Crypto Tools 102
Journey down the rabbit hole with this hands-on tutorial. Learn the tools of the crypto trade. 

## Introduction

Crypto Tools 102 is Part II of a tutorial series designed for beginners to learn crypto concepts in a simulated environment. In Part II, you will learn about: 
- genterating

## Scenario 

CryptoTools Pty Ltd went on a hiring spree.  They recruited [12 new apprentices](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x0e416a6e1dbc52a5ef446ca8cc481aa719c4fc8f#balances). 

Some of the apprentices unionised by creating the [toolUnion DAO](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x89/0x3a8b51b58799bf1459b0d2d1577fdb0f8e995dbe)

The management of Crypto Tools Pty Ltd found out about the toolUnion.  They have been unsuccessfully deploying their considerable treasury of BUCKS to pay for union busting programs. 

The shareholders of Crypto Tools Pty Ltd are fed up. You hear they will be moving to terminate all employees who joined the toolUnion DAO. It appears there is a [shareholder vote scheduled for tomorrow](https://snapshot.org/#/cryptotoolco.eth/proposal/0x553d937eb6227b5449d4b34ebce0c5c5f2aef629d3741342cce51996886006ea).   

The company's shares are [ERC20 fungible tokens](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x9f77bb2da32cc9bc0962b1e0fbd9c294051dcb4a). The shares trade permissionlessly with the ticker 'TOOL' on public markets. 

You need to coordinate with the other members of toolUnion DAO to do something about Crypto Tools Pty Ltd!  

*All tokens are entirely valueless.*
